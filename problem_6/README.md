# Scoreboard API Module Specification

## Overview
This document is for the Scoreboard API module. It is used to update user scores when they complete an action. The module will show the top 10 user scores on a website.

## Requirements
1. **Display Scores**: The application must show the top 10 user scores.
2. **Live Updates**: The scoreboard should update in real time when scores change.
3. **User Actions**: Users perform actions that will increase their scores. We do not need to explain these actions.
4. **API Call**: When a user completes an action, an API call must be made to update their score.
5. **Security**: We need to stop bad users from changing scores without permission.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Update Score
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/scores/update`
- **Description**: This updates the score for a user after they complete an action.
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
        "userId": "string", // The user's ID, like "12345"
        "actionId": "string", // The ID of the action, not sure what this is
        "score": 10 // The score to add, could be any number
    }
    ```
- **Responses**:
    - **200 OK**: Score updated successfully.
    - **400 Bad Request**: There is something wrong with the input, maybe the user ID is wrong.
    - **401 Unauthorized**: The user is not allowed, but I do not know how to fix this.
    - **500 Internal Server Error**: There is a problem with the server.

### 2. Get Top Scores
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/scores/top`
- **Description**: This gets the top 10 user scores.
- **Responses**:
    - **200 OK**:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "userId": "string",
            "score": 100 // Example score
        },
        // More users...
    ]
    ```

## Security Measures
- **Authorization**: Each API call needs a token to verify the user.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests to prevent abuse.
- **Input Validation**: Check the input data to stop bad data.

## Additional Comments
- **Documentation Clarity**: It would be better if everything was clearer, but it is okay.
- **Versioning**: It may be good to version the API, but I do not know how to do this.
- **Testing**: Testing is important, but I am not sure how to write tests yet.
- **Logging**: Logging actions can help track problems, but I do not know how to implement it.

## Conclusion
This document provides a basic specification for the Scoreboard API module. It should help the backend team to implement the necessary features. If there are questions, please ask!
